          G&apos;day, I&apos;m Dylan! I&apos;m a junior studying ECE/CS at Duke University,
          which actually means that I just camp out in the makerspaces fixing code, shorting wires, 
          and commiserating with other engineers. I grew up in Sydney, Australia, but decided to trade in the beaches and 
          sunshine for the chance to learn amazing things alongside even more amazing people at Duke.

          I am the project lead for Qubit at Duke&apos;s <a className="font-medium text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400 overflow-wrap: break-word hover:text-blue-600" href='https://sites.duke.edu/createcenter'>Center for Research and Engineering of AI Technology in Education</a>, where we make transformative AI tools for education.
          Qubit&apos;s mission is to bring a world-class AI tutor to every 
          student&apos;s code editor. So far, Qubit is already helping hundreds of students from the high school through to graduate levels, 
          and our early results are really exciting!

          Before coming to Duke, I built fire risk models for an Australian Government-funded bushfire resilience 
          app at the Resilient Building Council. To date, it&apos;s enabled 19,000 homeowners to make their houses two-thirds 
          less likely to catch on fire, and has been responsible for $44,000,000 of investment in fire safety across the country.
          I got the gig after one of my projects was <Link className="font-medium text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400  overflow-wrap: break-word hover:text-blue-600" href='https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=347355687124444'>featured on Australian TV.</Link>

          Now, the serious stuff: I coach an under-6 basketball team (go Dinos!) that finished the season with a 
          glorious 3-5 record. I also love doing martial artsâ€”I took up judo 12 years ago after watching Kung Fu Panda, 
          and ended up becoming an two-division Australian junior champion by mastering the Wuxi Finger Hold.
