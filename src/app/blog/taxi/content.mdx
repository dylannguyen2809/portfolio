One of the most exciting personal developments I’ve made during the past few months has been working up the courage to talk to taxi drivers. They are some of the most fascinating people I’ve ever met, and speaking to them is a kind of cross-sectional study of the human condition. I’ve met drivers who dream of moving out from the city they’ve lived in their whole life, and drivers who never want to leave. I’ve met a driver working the graveyard shift to afford medicine for his sick 3-year-old, another working to support his wife’s painting career, another who was about to move back home to be with the love of his life. I’ve met drivers who were refugees, drivers who wore dragon wings, drivers who lost friends to drug abuse. And while it seems my chattiness can annoy them—my Uber rating is so bad I sometimes can’t get a ride—these conversations have been nothing but enlightening for me. Last week, I asked a driver who had just had his 72nd birthday how he “figured it out”. He took a long pause, then a deep breath, then said, “It’ll happen. Just live. Just live.”

I think he’s right. I’m uncertain about many things, but what I do know is that I get to—and need to—choose how I’m going to live. These choices may happen consciously or unconsciously, but they will happen regardless. I also know that I do not exist in a vacuum—I live through my interactions with the world. I receive from the world around me and produce within it. And, to a large extent, I get to choose how these processes of reception and production take place. Viewed this way, my life becomes a series of choices about what I take in and what I create. The way I make these choices is then, to borrow an Aristotelian term, my “work” as a human being.

While I still have time to do this work, I want to do it well, which for me means to make choices that promote my flourishing as a human being. This is the ultimate good towards which I want to orient my life. My understanding of what it means to flourish is closely aligned with Charles Taylor’s<sup><sup>[\[1\]](#footnote-0)</sup></sup> “ideal of authenticity”—I want to be true to myself, and this can only be done by cultivating my moral virtues through a lifetime of persistent self-reflection, of growing through my struggle to improve, of building a soul that betters my habits and building habits that better my soul.

This cultivation of virtues is intimately linked to how I choose to interact with the world. I think that the processes of reception and production that I carry out each day can also be done virtuously. Specifically, I think that to receive virtuously is to cultivate gratitude, and to produce virtuously is to cultivate agency. I believe that, if I can live according to these virtues of agency and gratitude, I will flourish. Through agency, I can muster the strength to fix what is broken, within the world and within myself. In striving for agency, I am also striving to master my soul and to become exactly the person I want to be. Through gratitude, I can fill my soul with the beauty of what is good in the world. I can love deeply, I can revel in joy, I can live out the meaning of my life every day.

What I’ve found, however, is that the world is structured in such a way that makes it challenging to live with agency and gratitude. Much of this difficulty stems from the mediating impact of technology in our everyday lives. In _Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life_, Albert Borgmann<sup><sup>[\[2\]](#footnote-1)</sup></sup> makes the point that our devices, pieces of technology whose purpose is to carry out a function and otherwise impact their surroundings in the least obtrusive manner possible, are inherently predisposed to separating their work into means and ends. The function of a device—its ends—are to be celebrated and promoted, while the machinery behind a device—its means—are to be hidden as much as possible, as to make no demands on our skill, strength, or attention.

The self-obscuring nature of our devices means that we often don’t pay much attention to how they accomplish their function. In fact, I’ve found myself being eager to hand over agency to my devices. In handing over this agency, however, I make myself powerless to challenge the assumptions that technology makes about how I want things to be done. My phone makes the assumption that I want to stay perpetually connected, which makes it difficult for me to unplug. Google makes the assumption that my goal with each search is to find only the most relevant information, which hampers my intellectual exploration. Email makes the assumption that I want to receive and respond as quickly as possible, which causes me to compulsively check my inbox as soon as I receive a notification. What worries me is that I rarely question these assumptions—I don’t find myself thinking that sometimes I don’t want to be connected online, that I don’t need to find the exact answer to every question, that I don’t want to receive instantaneous correspondence. In fact, it’s at times challenging to even define what I want from technology, and to consider whether the devices that are supposed to be serving me are doing so well. In a world where cars move for me, phones communicate for me, and artificial intelligence now thinks for me, it’s harder than ever to make the choices that comprise my work as a human. It’s true that devices can often achieve the ends that I pursue much more efficiently that I can, but by taking away my agency over the means through which those ends are achieved, they also take away opportunities for me to cultivate my virtue and to ultimately flourish.

The primacy of technology in the digital age also has severe consequences for my ability to practise gratitude. Gratitude is a mode of reception, and the work of reception is now often mediated by technology. A consequence of this mediation is that my senses receive filtered information, and I am encouraged to notice what my technological filters make salient and to ignore what they make obscure. Personal headphones, for example, encourage me to literally “tune out” the outside world. I don’t really know what campus sounds like. I don’t know how many conversations I’ve missed out on. I don’t know how many bird calls I’ve ignored. Headphones are immersive, but they are also numbing. My use of them has caused me to be habitually numbed to parts of my life that I would have liked to experience.

On a broader scale, the same argument can be applied to the way that social media encourages me to view my experience of the world. My hobbies, travels and creations are no longer just things for me to enjoy, but they should also look appealing enough for me to display to other people. I notice how tasty my food looks at the expense of noticing how good it tastes; I notice how beautiful my views are at the summit at the expense of noticing how beautiful the hike up the mountain was; I notice the successes that feed my ego at the expense of noticing the failures that build my character. Social media seeks to convince others—and myself—that who I seem to be is who I am, that the parts of me worth noticing can all be captured by mere pictures and words.

For me, to practise gratitude is to expose my heart, mind and senses directly to the world and to allow myself to notice things as they are, unmediated by technology or expectation or agenda. It is to be in awe of the world and to do the work that awe requires. I can choose to notice what is beautiful about this broken world; I can choose to notice that the joy of experiencing what I love far outweighs the burden of suffering what I hate; I can choose to notice that, despite its corruption and sinfulness and depravity, this world is absolutely one worth fixing. The digital age makes it difficult to practise agency and gratitude well, but I intend to practise them anyway.

While I am far from being successful in this endeavour, my attempts to do so throughout my life have given me some ideas about what might work. This first and most important of these ideas is friendship. I’ve been blessed in many ways throughout my life, but the love that I share with my friends and my family will always be the blessing for which I’m most grateful. Aristotle<sup><sup>[\[3\]](#footnote-2)</sup></sup> points out that, from a moral virtue perspective, friendship begets virtue by giving us the ability to perform good deeds for others, as well as giving us partners who will help us to better think and act. He even goes as far as saying that friendships are “most necessary with a view to life.” This is an idea with which I wholeheartedly agree. Friendship is agency and gratitude rolled into one—to be a good friend is to give the best parts of yourself to others, and to appreciate the parts of others that have been given to you. My friends enrich my flourishing every time they interact with me, and I hope to do the same for them. In this thread, I’m going to spend as much of my time as possible with my friends while they’re all still around—I will have conversations and plan events that deepen and strengthen our relationships, I will look out for them and lend an ear when they need one, and I will give as much of myself as I can.

Another practise that I have found to be immensely useful throughout the past year or so, and one that I intend to continue with, is regular gratitude journaling. Each morning (or as many mornings as I can), I take the time to write in my gratitude journal about three things from the previous day that I am grateful for, as well as three things from that day that I am looking forward to. My motivations for gratitude journaling have changed in the time that I have been doing it—it used to be a way for me to simply improve my mood through reflection and anticipation, but I have since come to see it as a way of reminding myself of the proper ordering of my priorities and my loves. Specifically, when I write the three things that I am looking forward to that day, I write in the hope that I will align my gratitude with what I should be grateful for, that I will place my higher loves above my lower loves. This is one method through which I’m trying to correct the flaws in my character and become the person I’d like to be.

The day before the start of this semester, I missed my connection flight from Chicago to Duke, and eventually found myself spending the night at a nearby Super 8 hotel. I had to get up at 4am the next morning to make the flight, and to the dismay of the hotel’s minivan driver, I intended to make use of their complimentary airport transit service to get there. Groggy and giddy from our early wake up, we spent the drive talking to each other to keep ourselves awake. He asked about my world—my schoolwork, my experiences with Australian wildlife, and my hopes—and I asked about his world—his family, his travels, and his dreams. I asked him how it was that, despite working an objectively unenviable job, he still managed to have a smile on his face at 4:30am in the morning.

“Happiness is simple, man. Just do what makes you happy.”

Here’s to doing just that.
